# LogicalWerewolves

This code is a logical implementation of the game Werewolves of Miller's Hollow. It simulates the knowledge of different agents and different voting strategies using higher-order and announcement logic. 

The website of the project containing further information about the logical formalization of the game can be found [here](https://mau-p.github.io/LogicalWerewolves/ "Visit project site").

## Running the code

Running the code in python requires two command line arguments: the number of werewolves and the number of villagers. The code can then be run as follows:

```
python3 main.py <n_werewolves> <n_villagers>
```
